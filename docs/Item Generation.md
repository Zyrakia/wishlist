## Items
Wishii uses AI to automatically extract product information from links you provide. Instead of manually entering item details, you can simply paste a product URL and let Wishii do the work.

## How Generation Works
When you provide a product URL, Wishii:
1. Visits the page and reads its content
2. Uses AI to identify and extract product information
3. Creates a preview card with the extracted details
4. Lets you review and confirm before adding to your list

The AI extracts the following information when available:
- **Name** - The product title
- **Price** - The current price
- **Currency** - The price currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
- **Image** - The main product image
- **URL** - A cleaned link back to the product page

## Generating an Item
1. Click "**Add Item**" on your list page
2. Paste the product URL into the **Generate From Link** field
3. Click "**Generate**"
4. Wait for the progress bar to complete (this usually takes a few seconds)
5. Review the preview card

After generation completes, you have three options:
- **Add to List** - Accept the generated item as-is
- **Edit** - Modify any details before adding
- **X (Cancel)** - Discard and try again

## Editing Generated Items
If the AI didn't capture something correctly, or you want to add personal notes:

1. Click "**Edit**" on the confirmation screen
2. Modify any fields in the form
3. Watch the preview update in real time as you type
4. Click "**Submit**" when satisfied

Common edits include:
- Adding personal notes about why you want the item
- Correcting a price that wasn't detected
- Adding a different image URL
- Shortening or clarifying the item name

## Adding Items Quickly
When adding multiple items, check the "**Keep Adding**" checkbox before clicking "**Add to List**". This returns you to the generation page immediately after adding, so you can paste your next URL right away.

## When Generation Fails
Generation may not work perfectly for all websites. If you see an error:

- **"No product found"** - The page doesn't appear to be a product page, or the layout isn't recognized
- **"Cannot render page"** - The page couldn't be loaded (may be behind a login or geo-restricted)
- **"Generation temporarily disabled"** - The AI service is temporarily unavailable; try again later

If generation consistently fails for a particular website, use the **Create Manually** option instead.

## Creating Items Manually
Click "**Create Manually**" on the item creation page to skip generation entirely. This opens a form where you can enter:

- **Name** (required) - What the item is
- **Notes** - Any additional details, links, or preferences
- **Price** - The item's price (optional)
- **Currency** - Three-letter currency code like USD, EUR, GBP
- **Purchase Link** - URL where the item can be purchased
- **Image Link** - URL to an image of the item

All fields except Name are optional. You can add as much or as little detail as you like.

## Supported Websites
Generation works best with standard e-commerce product pages. Most major online retailers and stores with standard product page layouts are supported.

Some websites may not work due to:
- Login requirements
- Heavy JavaScript rendering
- Unusual page structures
- Geographic restrictions

## Tips for Better Results
- Use the direct product page URL, not a search results or category page
- Avoid URLs with referral codes or tracking parameters when possible
- If an item has multiple variations, navigate to the specific one you want before copying the URL
- For very new products, details may not be fully available on the retailer's page yet

## A Note About Pricing
Prices extracted during generation reflect what was displayed on the page at that moment. They may not account for:

- Regional pricing differences
- Currency conversion
- Sales or promotions that have since ended
- Shipping costs or taxes

If accurate pricing is important, verify the price on the original product page before making a purchase.
