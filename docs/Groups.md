Groups allow you to gather all your family members and friends, and view all of their lists in one place at the same time. No more scattered group chats, and definitely no more texting back and forth about who bought who which present.

While in a group with another user, you will be able to reserve items on their wishlist, marking it as reserved for every other person.

## Creating a Group
Click **"Create your Own"** in the **Groups** section on the homepage or navigate to `/new-group`.  

**Note:** You may own **one group** at a time, but you can join **unlimited** groups created by others.

## Deleting a Group
On your group page, click the red **Trash** icon at the top. You will be asked to confirm the deletion.

After confirmation, all members will be removed and the group is deleted. Any pending invites will be invalidated.

This is an irreversible action.

## Managing a Group
To manage your own group, including inviting new members, you can click **Manage** besides your group on the homepage. This will redirect you to your group page.

## Editing a Group
On your group page, click the **Edit** button at the top to change the group name.

## Inviting Group Members
On the group page, enter the email of the person you want to invite and click "**Invite**"

The recipient will receive an email shortly that specifies that you invited them to a group on Wishii.

Recipients do not need an account to receive an invite. If they have an account, they can accept from the homepage or from the email. If they do not have an account, they will be able to accept the invite and create an account from the link in the email.

## Accepting a Group Invite
If you have any pending group invites, they will appear on the homepage, where you can choose to accept or reject.

Otherwise, you can follow the link in the invite email to be prompted to either accept or reject the invite.

If you do not have an account, you will be prompted to create one while accepting the invite. The email associated with your account **MUST** match the email that was invited.

## Removing Group Members
On your group page, click the **Person with X** icon beside the member you want to remove. No confirmation is needed and the user will immediately be removed from the group.

At any time, you will be able to send another invite to removed users.

## Leaving a Group
If you are a member of a group (not the owner), you can leave by navigating to the group page and clicking **Leave Group**.

After leaving, any reservations you made on items belonging to that group's members will be removed if you no longer share another group with those users.

## Viewing Group Activity
On the homepage, each group you belong to displays recent activity from its members. Lists that have been updated within the last day are marked with an "Updated" badge, making it easy to see what's new.

Click **View all lists** (or **Manage** for your own group) to see the full group page with all members and their lists.
