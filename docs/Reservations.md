When you share a group with a user, you are able to mark items as reserved on their lists.

The reservation status of an item will be displayed to other users who share a group with the list owner.

Reservations let you prevent duplicate gifts with ease.

## Reserving an Item
On a list page of a user who you share a group with, you can click the button under each item reading "**Reserve**" at which point you will be prompted to confirm your reservation.

After you have placed your reservation, to other users, the button will read "**Someone has reserved this item**" and it will be disabled, not allowing another reservation to be placed on the same item.

## Removing a Reservation
Under an item that you have reserved, click the button that reads "**Remove Reservation**". 

After clicking this button the item will be available for anyone to reserve again.

## Reservation Visibility
Reservations on a list are visible to anyone who shares a group with the list owner, regardless of if they share a group with the person who reserved the item.

This means that if the list owner is part of other groups, there is still no chance of duplicate gifts being given from someone you do not know.

To anonymous users, and users who do not share a group with the list owner, all existing reservations will be invisible and they will not be able to place any new ones.

## Reservation Cleanup
If you leave a group, your reservations on items belonging to that group's members will be automatically removed—unless you still share another group with those users.

This ensures that reservations only exist between users who are connected through at least one common group.
