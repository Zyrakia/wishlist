## Connections
Connections allow you to link external wishlists from other websites to your Wishii list. Items from these external lists are automatically synced and kept up to date, allowing you to centralize all your wishes in one easily shareable place.

## How Connections Work
When you create a connection, Wishii visits the external list URL and extracts all the product information it can find. This includes item names, prices, images, and links back to the original product pages.

The extracted items appear on your Wishii list just like manually added items, but they are linked to the connection. If the external list changes, you can sync the connection to update your Wishii list.

## Creating a Connection
1. Navigate to your list and click "**Edit**" at the top
2. Scroll down to the **Manage Connections** section
3. Enter a name for your connection (e.g., "My Other Wishlist")
4. Paste the URL of your external wishlist
5. Click "**Create Connection**"

An initial sync will happen automatically. If successful, the items will appear on your list. If there's an issue, a red **X** will appear next to the connection name.

**Note:** You can have up to 5 connections per list.

## Syncing a Connection
Connections do not sync automatically. To update items from an external list:

1. Navigate to your list and click "**Edit**"
2. Find the connection in the **Active Connections** section
3. Click the **Refresh** icon beside the connection name

Syncing can only be done once per hour. If you attempt to sync too soon, you will see a message indicating when the next sync will be available.

## Sync Errors
If a sync fails, a red **X** will appear beside the connection name. Common causes include:

- The external list URL has changed or is no longer accessible
- The external list is set to private
- The website structure has changed in a way Wishii cannot read

To troubleshoot, verify that the external list URL is correct and that the list is publicly accessible. Then try syncing again.

## Removing a Connection
1. Navigate to your list and click "**Edit**"
2. Find the connection in the **Active Connections** section
3. Click the red **Trash** icon

**Important:** When you remove a connection, all items that were synced from that connection are also removed from your list. Items you added manually are not affected.

## Connection Items vs Manual Items
Items synced from a connection are linked to that connection. You can identify these items by the connection indicator that appears on them.

If you delete a connection item manually (using the **Trash** icon on the item), it will reappear after the next sync if it still exists on the external list.

To permanently remove a connection item, either:
- Remove it from the original external list, then sync
- Remove the entire connection

## Supported Websites
Connections work best with public wishlist pages that display product information clearly. Most e-commerce wishlist, favorites, or product listing pages are supported.

**Important:** The external list must be publicly accessible. If the list is set to private or requires a login to view, Wishii will not be able to see any items and the sync will fail.

## Tips for Better Sync Results
- Ensure your external list is set to public
- Use the direct URL to the wishlist page, not a search or browse page
- If items aren't syncing correctly, try removing and re-creating the connection
- Keep external lists reasonably sized for faster syncing

## A Note About Pricing
Prices synced from external lists reflect what was displayed on the page at the time of sync. They may not account for:

- Regional pricing differences
- Currency conversion
- Sales or promotions that have since ended
- Shipping costs or taxes

If accurate pricing is important, verify the price on the original product page before making a purchase.
