## Wishlists
Lists, or "wishlists", are the core feature of Wishii. You can have an unlimited amount of lists, each an have an unlimited amount of items on it.

On your list, you can prioritize items, reorder them in any way and delete items that you have received or no longer want.

## Creating a List
To create a list, you must navigate to `/new-list` or click the "New List" button on the homepage.

When creating a new list, you must specify a name and a unique "share link" or "slug". The slug will uniquely identify your list when sharing it via URL. It is automatically generated from your name, if it is taken though, you must modify it to be unique.

After entering all the details, you must click "**Submit**", at which point you are redirected to your new empty list.

## Deleting a List
To delete your list, you must click the red **Trash** icon at the top of your list page.

After clicking the icon, you will be asked to confirm the deletion. After confirmation, the list and all associated data is permanently deleted.

This is an irreversible action.

## Editing a List
Your list can be edited after creation by clicking the button at the top of your list page that reads "**Edit**".

On the edit page, you are able to change the initial list properties, as well as manage your list connections.

## Creating a Connection
A list connection can mirror a list on a different website on your Wishii list, allowing you to centralize all of your wishes in one, easily shareable place.

This is done by asking the external website for details about the items, and then automatically syncing them into your Wishii list.

To create a connection, you must click the button at the top of your list page that reads "**Edit**". On this page you will see the section labelled "**Manage Connections**". When creating a connection, you must provide a name and the link (URL) to the external list.

After clicking "**Create Connection**", an initial sync will take place. If there is an issue during this initial sync, a red **X** will appear next to the connection name. If this occurs, please try to resync the connection by clicking the **Refresh** icon besides the connection name, it will let you know the specific issue that is preventing sync.

## Removing a Connection
To remove a connection from your list, you must navigate to your list edit page by clicking the "**Edit**" button at the top.

On the edit page, you can click the red **Trash** icon, at which point your connection will be removed.

When a connection is removed from your list, all items synced from the connection are also removed.

## Syncing a Connection
You can manually sync your connection by clicking the **Refresh** icon besides the connection name on the list edit page. This can be done maximum once per hour.

After you update your external list, it is recommended that you manually resync your connection on Wishii so that the items will already be updated when someone visits your list.

## List Privacy
Currently, all lists are publicly accessible by their URL. In the future, private or group-only lists will be available.

## Sharing a List
To share your list with others, click the **Share** button at the top of your list page.

On devices that support native sharing (most mobile devices), this will open the system share menu where you can send the link via any app.

On other devices, clicking **Share** will copy the list URL to your clipboard. You can then paste this link anywhere to share it.

## Adding an Item
To add a new item, click the "**Add Item**" button at the top of your list page.

This will redirect you to the item creation page. Here you can choose to enter a link to an item for automatic generation, or create one manually.

### Generating from a Link
1. Paste the product URL into the **Generate From Link** field
2. Click "**Generate**"
3. Wait for Wishii to extract the item details (name, price, image, etc.)
4. Review the preview card to verify the information is correct
5. Click "**Add to List**" to add the item, or "**Edit**" to modify details first

If the generation didn't capture the item correctly, click the **X** button to cancel and try again, or proceed with manual entry.

### Adding Multiple Items
When adding items, you can check the "**Keep Adding**" checkbox before clicking "**Add to List**". This will return you to the generation page after adding the item, allowing you to quickly add multiple items in succession.

### Creating Manually
If you prefer to enter all details yourself, or if generation doesn't work for a particular website, click "**Create Manually**" to access the full item form.

## Deleting an Item
To delete any item from your list, you can click the red **Trash** icon under the item on your list page. You will be asked if you are sure, at which point you can click **Yes** to finalize the deletion.

This action is irreversible after confirmation.

## Editing an Item
To edit any item on your list, you can click the **Settings** icon (next to the red **Trash** icon) under the item on your list page. This will redirect you to a form where you can modify the properties of the item, while previewing what it will look like after you are done in real time.

If you choose not to save your changes, you can click the **Back** icon at the top of the page besides the label reading "**Edit Mode**". Otherwise, you can save your changes by clicking the "**Submit**" button at the bottom of the edit form.

## Prioritizing an Item
You can choose an unlimited amount of items on your list to "prioritize" or "favorite". This is done by clicking the **Star** icon under the item on your list page.

After an item is marked as prioritized, it is given an accented border and glow, allowing it to stand out naturally on your list.

You can remove this effect by clicking the same icon again.

## Reorganizing Items
To reorder items in any order you want, you can enter reorganization mode by clicking the "**Reorganize**" button at the top of your list page.

In reorganization mode, you will be able to drag items around the item grid, pushing other items aside as you move. When you are done, you can click the "**Save**" that appears on the bottom right of your screen in organization mode. You can also click the original "**Reorganize**" button, which will read "**Save**" as well when in reorganization mode.

## Sorting Items (For Viewers)
When viewing someone else's list, you can sort the items using the **Sort Items** dropdown at the top of the list page.

Available sorting options:
- **Default** - The order set by the list owner
- **Price (Low to High)** - Cheapest items first
- **Price (High to Low)** - Most expensive items first
- **Created (Newest to Oldest)** - Recently added items first
- **Created (Oldest to Newest)** - Oldest items first

Your selected sort preference is temporary and will reset when you leave the page.
